# Dependencies

The source of truth is [`packaging/dependencies.json`](../packaging/dependencies.json).
Release tooling generates PKGBUILD dependency fields from this inventory. `defaultInstall`
selects the full installation profile; optional authorization and vendor GPU drivers are never implicit.

Runtime-only dependencies are assigned in package functions, so this repository builds and
tests independently of other Clavis repositories. CI installs only build, check and CI entries.

## Bundled resources

Google Sans Flex and its license are tracked in `assets/fonts/google-sans-flex`. Material
Symbols Rounded/Outlined are supplied by `ttf-material-symbols-variable`; an already installed
compatible provider is retained. Shell font settings keep their existing fallback behavior.

Meteocons SVG 0.1.0 and Lottie 0.1.0 are fetched from fixed npm registry URLs with SHA-256
verification during release-source preparation. No npm runtime or first-launch download is needed.
The source archive contains SVG fill/flat/line/monochrome, Lottie fill, and the upstream MIT notice.
M3Shapes remains an external QML module and is never built or vendored by Clavis.

The Arch baseline is Quickshell 0.3.1 with networking, Bluetooth, PAM, PipeWire and UPower
enabled. Clavis native gamma control requires Qt 6.8 or newer. `libcava` must supply the
shared library and pkg-config interface; installing the `cava` command alone is insufficient.

NetworkManager, BlueZ, UPower and PipeWire must be usable in the session. Installation does
not switch audio servers, replace GPU drivers, enable system daemons, add device groups or
configure a credential store. DDC/backlight access uses distribution udev/logind policy.
Map-provider credentials and Rclone authentication are supplied by the user in the existing UI.

### Weather place names

Saved weather coordinates are reverse-geocoded through Nominatim. Forecasts always
use the original coordinates; the returned city/town/region is only a display name.
Successful names are cached in Clavis Weather settings; failed lookups back off for
24 hours and retain the coordinate label. Names use the service's local-language
response. Requests are serialized with at least 1.1 seconds between network lookups,
with an identifying User-Agent and a compact map-corner attribution for OpenFreeMap, OpenMapTiles, and OpenStreetMap
in both location picker views.
Map dragging does not perform lookups.

The [public Nominatim usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/)
limits aggregate application traffic to 1 request/second and requires caching and
attribution. Larger deployments must use a suitable provider or their own instance.
Set `CLAVIS_GEOCODING_URL` to a compatible reverse endpoint to change providers
without updating Clavis. The endpoint receives the saved coordinates; cached results
are scoped to the endpoint. IP-based automatic location continues to use ipwho.is.

The installer maps first-party package bases and split permission packages through
`releaseSources` in the manifest. Generated installers pin Clavis to their release version;
backend releases are resolved independently and checked against the runtime requirements.
