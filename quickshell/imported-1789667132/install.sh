# There is already a one-click installer and a release here; I just haven't had
# time to test them yet.
# No matter how this project turns out, people will still mock and insult me.
# I won't make promises to anyone anymore. My commitments to this project have
# brought me nothing in return and have instead become a burden.
# Once I started treating it as my own toy project, everything became much easier.
# I don't have to answer to anyone.
# If you're planning to save the world, please leave me out of it.
# I need to go save my own world first.
#
# Small raw-GitHub entry point. A complete, verified release installer does the work.
