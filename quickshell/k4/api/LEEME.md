# Writing a k4 plugin

This is the quick reference. For complete guides see:

- [Public API](../docs/API.md)

- [Creating a game plugin](../docs/GAMES.md)

> A plugin imports `QtQuick` and `K4`. Nothing else from the host.

## Minimal plugin

```qml
import QtQuick
import K4 as K4
import "../../core"

K4Plugin {
    id: self
    name: "hello"
    title: "Hello"
    priority: 70
    active: habilitado && abierto
    islandWidth: 300
    islandHeight: 120

    property bool abierto: false

    view: Component {
        Item {
            IslandLabel { anchors.centerIn: parent; text: "Hello" }
        }
    }

    K4.Ipc {
        target: "k4.hello"
        function toggle(): void { self.abierto = !self.abierto }
    }
}
```

`K4Plugin` is the contract: it declares when the plugin wants the island, its
requested size, the view to render and keyboard behavior. The host binds
`habilitado` to `PluginManager`; it is different from `active`:

```qml
K4.Process { running: self.habilitado && self.abierto }
Timer { running: self.habilitado && self.abierto }
```

Processes, timers and IPC handlers are direct children of the plugin. A view is
mounted only while the host gives the plugin the island, so long-lived work must
not be declared inside the view.

| `K4.Ajustes` | Your own settings inside the bar's Settings — switches, choices, free text (`secreto` for keys) |
| `K4.Huella` | Aggregated personal data (Steam, packages), double-keyed: `datos-personales` permission + per-source user opt-in |
| `K4.Lanzador` | Contribute results to the launcher |
| `K4.Isla` | Island state: open, occupant, maximum height — plus `rect`/`rectEn()`/`posicion` (geometry, per screen) — `efecto()` (shake, push, tug) and `colocar()` (slide along the edge) |

## Catalog and registration

Plugins are loaded **dynamically**, one by one, each in its own try: a plugin
that fails to compile is recorded with its error and the bar starts without
it. Disabled means not instantiated.

A plugin of your own goes in `~/.config/k4/plugins/<id>/` with a `plugin.json`
manifest — nothing in this repository is touched. See `docs/PLUGINS.md`;
`ejemplos/hola` and `ejemplos/snake` are complete, runnable examples.

A plugin contributed to the repository goes under `plugins/` with a `qmldir`
listing every type in the folder (sibling types do not resolve without it) and
an entry in `plugins/catalog.json`. It is no longer imported or instantiated in
`shell.qml`.

Validate the result with:

```sh
python3 tools/plugins.py
python3 tools/api.py
```

Third-party plugins are loaded, so read the honest security note in
`docs/PLUGINS.md`: declared permissions are informed consent plus static
analysis, not a sandbox. QML runs in the bar's process.

## API changes

If a plugin needs a capability that is missing, add it under `api/K4/` rather
than importing a private Quickshell type in the plugin. Keep the wrapper small,
document its signals and properties, and update `docs/API.md` with an example.
Restart the bar after changing the `K4` module because QML caches imported
modules.
