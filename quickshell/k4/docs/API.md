# k4 public API

This is the public surface available to plugins. The API lives in `api/K4/`; the
source files contain additional implementation notes.

## Imports

A plugin imports Qt and k4:

```qml
import QtQuick
import K4 as K4
```

Start the host with `arrancar`. It adds `api/` to `QML_IMPORT_PATH`; launching
`quickshell -p shell.qml` directly will not resolve `import K4`.

Qt (`QtQuick`, `QtMultimedia`, `Timer`, animations, and so on) is the portable
layer. Quickshell and Wayland should stay behind a `K4` API type whenever an
equivalent exists.

## Plugin contract

`K4Plugin` is the root object of a module:

| Property | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Stable, unique plugin ID |
| `title` | Human-readable name |
| `habilitado` | Persistent user permission |
| `active` | Requests the island right now |
| `priority` | Arbitration priority |
| `transitorio` | View that appears unasked and expires on its own; it closes the moment another plugin takes the island |
| `islandWidth`, `islandHeight` | Requested island size |
| `view` | Component rendered by the host |
| `viewLoaded` | Keep the size while the view closes |
| `grabKeyboard` | Exclusive keyboard focus |
| `tecladoOpcional` | On-demand keyboard focus |
| `closeOnHoverExit` | Enable hover-exit timeout |

`active` and `habilitado` are different states:

```qml
K4Plugin {
    name: "hello"
    active: habilitado && abierto
    property bool abierto: false
}
```

Repo modules import that root type from `core/`; third-party plugins use the
same contract as `K4.Plugin`.

## Visual components

The bar's look, ready to assemble — every piece takes the palette from
`K4.Tema` so a plugin lands looking native:

| Type | What it is |
|---|---|
| `K4.Etiqueta` | Text with the bar's defaults (white, Adwaita, 12px) |
| `K4.Glifo` | A Nerd Font glyph (find codepoints with `tools/glifos.py`) |
| `K4.Icono` | An `IconImage` ready to render application icons |
| `K4.IconoPlugin` | A plugin's own image, falling back to a glyph |
| `K4.Interruptor` | The bar's switch |
| `K4.Deslizador` | The bar's slider |
| `K4.Medidor` | A read-only bar: `valor` out of `maximo`, with the house track and easing |
| `K4.Baldosa` | Pressable card: hover lift, press sink |
| `K4.Boton` | Round one-glyph button |
| `K4.Aparicion` | Fade-in for views |
| `K4.Rodillo` | Scrollable column whose wheel works over hoverable rows |
| `K4.FocoInicial` | Grabs keyboard focus when a view opens |

`ejemplos/piezas/` is the runnable showcase of all of them.

## Plugin state that survives: `K4.Guardado`

For game saves, counters, anything that must outlive a restart. It owns a
JSON file under the plugin's own state directory:

```qml
property var guardado: K4.Guardado {
    plugin: "hello"
    onCargado: function (d) { self.visitas = d.visitas || 0 }
}

function apuntar() {
    guardado.guardar({ visitas: visitas })
}
```

Prefer it over raw `K4.Fichero` for plugin state: the path, the directory
and the load signal are handled for you.

## Spanish first, translated everywhere: `K4.Idioma`

Wrap every user-facing string in `K4.Idioma.t("…")` and format with
`K4.Idioma.f("%1 things", n)`. Source strings are Spanish; `en.json` and
friends translate, and missing entries fall back to the original.

## Processes: `K4.Process`

`K4.Process` wraps an external process and provides two output modes:

```qml
K4.Process {
    id: query
    command: ["python3", K4.Paths.guion("data.py")]
    running: abierto
    onSalida: function (text) { model = JSON.parse(text) }
    onLineaError: function (line) { console.warn(line) }
}
```

For one event per line:

```qml
K4.Process {
    command: ["my-command", "--watch"]
    porLineas: true
    running: true
    onLinea: function (line) { ... }
}
```

Properties include `command`, `running`, `workingDirectory`, `environment`,
`porLineas` and `entradaAbierta`. Signals are `arrancado`, `linea`, `salida`,
`lineaError` and `terminado(code)`. Stop a process that writes a file with
`parar()` (SIGINT), not a hard kill.

## Files and paths

`K4.Paths` keeps plugins independent from filesystem layout:

```qml
readonly property string statePath: K4.Paths.estado + "/hello.json"
K4.Fichero { id: state; path: statePath; blockLoading: true }

function save() {
    state.setText(JSON.stringify({ count: count }, null, 2))
}
```

- `K4.Paths.estado`: `~/.local/state/k4`, for persistent state.
- `K4.Paths.raiz`: the k4 installation root.
- `K4.Paths.guion(name)`: a file inside `tools/`.
- `K4.Paths.enRaiz(relative)`: any repository asset.

`K4.Fichero` provides `path`, `text()`, `setText()`, `blockLoading` and
`onLoaded`. Use it for small JSON/text files, not media assets.

## System and applications

`K4.Sistema` provides desktop actions:

```qml
K4.Sistema.abrir(path)
K4.Sistema.lanzar(["program", "--option"])
K4.Sistema.avisar("Title", "Details", false)
K4.Sistema.copiar("text")
const home = K4.Sistema.entorno("HOME")
```

`K4.Apps.lista` contains installed desktop entries; `K4.Apps.porId(id)` looks
one up and `K4.Apps.icono(name)` resolves its icon. `K4.Icono` is an
`IconImage` ready to render.

## Reading the machine

Live system data, one wrapper per source. Reading is free; the few write
operations are permission-gated (see the manifest permissions below):

| Type | Reads | Gated writes |
|---|---|---|
| `K4.Audio` | volume, mute | `ponerVolumen`, `alternarSilencio` → `audio` |
| `K4.Medios` | player, track, artwork | `alternarPausa`, `siguiente`… → `medios` |
| `K4.Red` | Wi-Fi and Bluetooth state | none — read-only, no exceptions |
| `K4.Escritorios` | Hyprland workspaces | — |
| `K4.Notificaciones` | notification count and recents | `limpiar` → `notificaciones` |
| `K4.Portapapeles` | clipboard history | reading is itself gated → `portapapeles` |
| `K4.Reloj` | the bar's clock | — |

## Sound: `K4.Sonido`

A short effect — `fuente` points at the audio file, `volumen` scales it.
Requires the `sonido` permission: a plugin that can make noise says so.

```qml
K4.Sonido {
    id: campana
    fuente: campana.delSistema("bell")
    volumen: 0.4
}
```

Then `campana.sonar()` plays it.
`delSistema(name)` resolves a desktop theme sound already installed on the
machine — `bell`, `message`, `complete`, `dialog-error` — so a plugin can
have sound without shipping audio files. Note it is a method **of the
object**, not of the type: `campana.delSistema(…)`, never
`K4.Sonido.delSistema(…)`, which fails silently inside the binding and
leaves you with no sound and no error. `listo` tells you whether it can
actually play.

## IPC, windows and shortcuts

Expose commands with `K4.Ipc`:

```qml
K4.Ipc {
    target: "k4.hello"
    function toggle(): void { self.abierto = !self.abierto }
}
```

Call it from Hyprland with:

```sh
quickshell ipc -p ~/.config/quickshell/k4/shell.qml call k4.hello toggle
```

- `K4.Ventana`: a full-screen `wlr-layer-shell` surface that does not reserve
  layout space.
- `K4.PorPantalla`: one instance per monitor.
- `K4.Cargador`: a `LazyLoader` for expensive views or windows.
- `K4.Atajo`: a global shortcut identified by `appid: "k4"` and `name`.
- `K4.Autenticacion`: PAM authentication state and signals.
- `K4.BloqueoSesion` and `K4.SuperficieBloqueo`: the real `ext-session-lock`
  and its per-output surface.
- `K4.MenuBandeja`: an application tray menu.

## Pill indicators

Plugins can register a small indicator without editing `shell.qml`:

```qml
Component.onCompleted: K4.Pildora.registrar(
    "hello.status", "ready", 0xF05A1, "#30d158", 80, true)

Connections {
    target: K4.Pildora
    function onInvocado(id) {
        if (id === "hello.status") self.abierto = true
    }
}
```

Available operations are `registrar(id, text, glyph, color, order, visible)`,
`actualizar(id, fields)`, `quitar(id)` and `quitarDe(owner)`. IDs must start with
the plugin ID (`hello.`). The host removes a plugin's indicators when it is
disabled.

## Your settings, in Settings

Plugins contribute rows to the bar's Settings screen with `K4.Ajustes`: the
plugin keeps the values, the bar asks for them (`valores`) and notifies
(`cambiado`). A switch per option is the default; `tipo` unlocks the rest:

- `"eleccion"`: chips with your own `alternativas: [{ codigo, nombre }]`;
  `cambiado` delivers the chosen `codigo`.
- `"texto"`: a free-text field — a URL, a model name, an API key. `pista`
  is the empty-field hint and `secreto: true` masks the value once typing
  stops. The value arrives on confirm (Enter or focus out), not per
  keystroke.

With these, a plugin that talks to a service, an AI or a CLI configures
itself in Settings like everything else.

## Your results in the launcher: `K4.Lanzador`

Answer the launcher's queries whenever you can — a slow source blocks
nobody. Your results appear below the system's applications:

```qml
K4.Lanzador {
    plugin: "hola"
    onBuscando: function (texto) {
        resultados = texto.length < 2 ? []
            : [{ id: "abrir", titulo: K4.Idioma.t("Abrir Hola"), desc: "…" }]
    }
    onElegido: function (id) { self.abierto = true }
}
```

## The island as a stage

- `K4.Tema.tintar(id, color, strength, durationMs)` tints the bar's neutral
  scaffold — island, surfaces, tracks — and everything painted with the
  theme recolors itself reactively. Ink and semantic colors stay untouched
  so text stays readable; strength is capped at 0.45 by the host, and
  `K4.Tema.destintar(id)` — or disabling the plugin — reverts it.
- `K4.Isla.efecto(id, name, strength)` asks for a physical gesture:
  `"sacudida"` (a hit), `"empujon"` (something heavy lands), `"tiron"`
  (something pulls, like a fish on the line). The host animates and
  rate-limits to one gesture per half second.
- `K4.Isla.rect` is the island's real screen geometry (`{ x, y, ancho,
  alto }`); with a transparent `K4.Ventana` above everything you can draw
  outside the island — a waving hand, a pet peeking over the edge.
- The bar's edge and alignment belong to the user (Settings: top/bottom,
  left/center/right). `K4.Isla.posicion` tells you the edge; and
  `K4.Isla.colocar(id, fraction, durationMs)` slides the island along it
  for the duration of a scene — a dodge, a paddle, stepping aside — and it
  springs back on timeout, `soltar(id)`, or disable.

`ejemplos/efectos/` has every piece working, hand included.

## Personal data: `K4.Huella`

Aggregated slices of the user's real life, under a **double key**: the
plugin declares the `datos-personales` manifest permission (just naming
`K4.Huella` demands it) AND the user enables each source individually in
Settings → "Datos personales" — everything off by default. Aggregation
happens in the python readers (`tools/huella.py`) before anything touches
QML, and forgetting is immediate.

Shipped sources: `steam` (`{ juegos, minutos, titulos }`) and `paquetes`
(`{ total, ultimaActualizacion }`). Check `K4.Huella.activa("steam")`
before reading — without both keys you get empty objects, never errors.

Planned next, same rules: focus time per app, local git rhythm, browser
domains (never URLs), shell binaries (never arguments). Hard red lines
that no permission opens: keylogging, notification or file contents,
mic/camera content — only a binary "in use" indicator.

## Current boundaries

Plugin loading is dynamic and isolated: each plugin is created on its own, a
failure is recorded with its error, and the rest start. Disabled means not
instantiated. Third-party plugins load from `~/.config/k4/plugins/<id>/`.

What that does **not** mean is a sandbox. QML runs inside the bar's process and
a loaded plugin can do whatever the bar can do. The declared permissions are
informed consent — you see them before enabling — plus a static analysis that
turns carelessness and simple deception into an installation error. Installing
a plugin is trusting its author.

Two doors stay shut on purpose: connecting to networks and pairing Bluetooth
devices are read-only for plugins, with no permission that opens them.

The full guide, kept current by `tools/api.py` and `tools/guia.py`, is
`docs/PLUGINS.md`. New dependencies still go in `dependencias.tsv`.
